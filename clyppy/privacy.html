    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Your privacy is a top priority for us. We are committed to protecting your personal information while abiding by
        all applicable laws and regulations concerning it.
    </p>

    <p class="small-text">This policy is effective as of 20 March 2024 and was last updated on 3/20/2024.</p>

    <p> This Privacy Policy describes how the creators or owners of CLYPPY (referred to as "the creators") collect,
        use, and protect your (the "User"'s) personal information obtained through the use of the CLYPPY Discord
        bot and/or website. By inviting the bot to one of your Discord servers or by otherwise using the bot or website
        (referred to as the "Service"), you acknowledge and consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Collected Information</h2>

    <p> By using the Service, information about all interactions between the User & the Service,
        including message IDs, server IDs, role IDs, and channel IDs, may be stored.</p>

    <p> The information collected by the Service is used solely for the purpose of operating and
        improvement of operations. The creators do not sell or disclose this information to third parties, except as
        required by law or to comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <p> The creators take reasonable measures to protect Users' personal information collected by the
        Service from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage over
        the internet is 100% secure, and the creators cannot guarantee absolute security, and take no responsibility
        over any data that is compromised as a result of a breach of security.</p>

    <h2>Limits to our Policy</h2>

    <p> Our service may contain links to unaffiliated third-party websites. Please be aware that the creators have no
        control over, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices or content of these websites.</p>

    <h2>Other Policies</h2>
    <p>By using the Service, you must agree to the policies of all affiliated services.
        If you do not agree to these policies, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>Message Content</h2>

    <p> CLYPPY has access to the content of Messages sent within Servers of which CLYPPY is a member, through Discord's
        MESSAGE_CONTENT Intent being enabled. Although CLYPPY has this functionality, Messages WILL NOT be monitored or
        stored in any way whatsoever. This functionality only exists for the integration of future features, so please
        stay updated for any new updates.
    </p>
